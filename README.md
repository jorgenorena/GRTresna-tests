# GRTresna

GRTresna is an open-source code for solving the constraint equations in numerical relativity.
It is developed and maintained by a collaboration of numerical relativists with a
wide range of research interests, and has already been used in many papers.

GRTresna is written entirely in C++14, using hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelism to achieve good performance on the latest architectures.
Furthermore, it makes use of the Chombo library for adaptive mesh refinement
to allow automatic increasing of the grid resolution in regions
of arbitrary shape and topology.
